			<p class="intro">My name is Adrian Anderson. When I was a child my mother brought me a Sony PSP for Christmas, by The New Year 
	  she brought me a small tool kit, flux, solder and an iron, by Valentine&#39;s Day I replaced the black casing with a 
	  gloss red one, put LED lights in the buttons and installed a custom firmware. If I was smart I would have sold it 
	  on EBay and reinvested my profits but, it was stolen before I thought about it. About 15 years later I&#39;m living in 
	  Las Vegas Nevada. I left college with a Sociology degree and somehow I found myself working as an Oracle Configuration 
	  Developer for leading companies in the gaming and bank security industries. After university my curiosity turned back 
	  to technology and this website is a testament to that; I built it just to see if I could. Here you&#39;ll find short 
	  writings on my interests, photos I&#39;ve taken, music that connects with me, an abstract of my skills and ways to 
	  get in touch with me.</p>
		<h2>Thanks for visiting!</h2>
